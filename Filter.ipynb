It is the middle of the 16th Century and young, ambitious noble families are reclaiming the dry hinterlands, building fields, forests, and lakes around their castles. Piece by piece - parcel by parcel - their holdings increase. Farmers work the fields, and in especially successful areas, monks found their influential cloisters. But everything happens under the watchful eyes of the nobility. Intrigues are hatched, tax collectors fleece the landowners, and far too often entire tracts of land are lost to locust plagues. Only he who keeps a cool head will become the Duke of Salamanca.&#10;&#10;Through clever use of cards in hand, players obtain tiles for placement (buildings, landscapes, privileges) as well as the ability to carry out certain actions. The tiles obtained are placed on tactically important spaces on the game board. Players can also place ownership markers onto buildings. By cleverly placing landscape tiles adjacent to the proper buildings, valuable regions can be formed that will bring in doubloons. Through the actions that can be gained by playing cards, players can bring plague stones (among other things) onto the board, and thereby block their opponents' tiles. The winner is the player with the most doubloons at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Welcome to world of Storm the Castle!, a 1-4 player semi-cooperative game in which you take the exciting role of one of the four marauding Dark Forces armies in a race to breach Castle StormHaven's walls, overrun the defenders, and claim victory by reaching the castle's keep first.&#10;&#10;Breaching Castle StormHaven's thick walls is no easy feat. It takes a desire for loot, hordes of your minions willing to be led to certain death (err, victory), cunning strategy, and a touch of treachery. The first player whose Dark Force unit enters the keep, by the end of turn eight, is truly the mightiest champion and claims total victory for his army.&#10;&#10;The Story So Far - The Invasion Begins!&#10;&#10;Castle StormHaven is guarded vigilantly by brave defenders comprised of an alliance between Men, Elves, Halflings, and Dwarves. For over 300 years, these defenders have repelled numerous invasions from the Badlands, home to the subterranean Dark Elf marauders and the mysterious sect of arcane bending wizards, the Arcanists. StormHaven is the first and last line of defense from keeping the fertile farmlands and gold mines of Western Holmenstein from being overrun.&#10;&#10;Years ago, a mysterious masked and exceptionally short villain appeared with the goal of uniting the Badlands and ruling over Holmenstein. Dubbed &quot;the Boss&quot; by his cohorts, he promised gold and power to those who would follow him. First the Dark Elves, then the Arcanists joined his Dark Forces. Soon after, the Orc pirate raiders joined the growing army and brought with them their crazed goblin allies and monstrous cousins, the giants. Knowing The Boss' army needed further strength to overwhelm Castle StormHaven's defenses, he revealed the last piece of strategy for domination, the Undead Horde of the BlackSoot Swamps.&#10;&#10;Now the four dark force armies &ndash; Dark Elves, Arcanists, Orc and Goblins of the Green Tide, and the innumerable Undead host &ndash; begin their long march east.&#10;&#10;Dark Force Army Overview&#10;&#10;Choosing your army is part of the fun of Storm the Castle! Each Dark Force army has unique units, power cards, combos and strategies. Is one better than the other - no! It&rsquo;s how you use your strengths while minimizing your weakness. Each army has a fair opportunity to win.&#10;&#10;The Green Tide: Orcs, goblins, giants, and other humanoids make up this loose tribal alliance. Specializing in brute force and strange Eastern technology, players who enjoy large explosions, brute strength, and dangerous yet untested weapons will enjoy smashing their way to victory with this army.&#10;&#10;Pros: Hard hitting units with lots of equipment upgrades. Power cards primarily focused on attacking and smashing. The rock lobber is one of the most effective siege weapons in the game. Goblin sappas provide for cheap, hard hitting units.&#10;Cons: Moderately expensive units. Lack of diversity in their power cards utility. Equipment can be deadly for both you and foe!&#10;&#10;The Arcanists: Mixing metal with magic produces stunning results. These masters of the forbidden arcane arts use their talents to manipulate the minds and outcomes of events of their allies and enemies. Players who enjoy using tactics that harness deadly magics and powers to manipulate events will surely enjoy the awesome power of the Arcanists.&#10;&#10;Pros: Incredible power cards that can shift game elements to your favor. Several long range spells and abilities to generate quick magic. &#10;Cons: Many of your units have low health and are easily destroyed.&#10;&#10;The Undead Horde: The walking dead from the Blacksoot Swamps know of one thing - how to feed! Their power derives from their ever increasing numbers and ability to sustain damage while pressing forward. Players looking to overwhelm the Fantasy Defenders with hordes of undead while using dark magic will find great pleasure in fielding this army.&#10;&#10;Pros: Your units cause fear and can take quite a bit of damage.  Inexpensive units allow you to swarm and overrun the Fantasy Defender&rsquo;s defenses. &#10;Cons: Though your units are many, they don&rsquo;t hit hard. Magic can be hard to build up as its dependent upon how many undead units you have in play.&#10;&#10;The Dark Elves: From the deep recesses of forgotten lands nestled deep within the earth come the masters of marauding, the Dark Elves. Known for their exceptional arts in battlefield tactics and archery, no foe is safe from the tips of their arrows to the teeth of their treachery. Players who revel in treachery, backstabbing and shooting should choose the Dark Elves.&#10;&#10;Pros:  Awesome ranged attacks and power cards to support them. Treacherous power cards give you a unique competitive edge against other players.&#10;Cons: Squishy units means you&rsquo;ve got to know when to fight and when to move in. Players may give you strange &ldquo;can I trust you&rdquo; looks. Lack of strong melee units.&#10;&#10;\",\n",

Four colored suitcases are placed in the center of the table, with the badger next to one of them.&#10;&#10;On a turn, the player rolls the die. If the die shows a color, the player places one of his items in the suitcase of this color; if the badger sits next to this suitcase, he places two items instead. If, however, the die shows a badger, the player must open the suitcase and reclaim all of the items packed inside &ndash; even if they weren't his to begin with! He then moves the badger to the next suitcase in the circle. One bonus to this punishment: If a player ever has a complete set of garments, he returns one of each item to the game box, removing them from the game.&#10;&#10;The first player to pack all of his garments wins the game.&#10;&#10;\",\n",

It's also a well-known fact that the only way to get to BE a bigger goblin is to eat a good breakfast.  This makes breakfast in the Goblin Warren a highly competitive and somewhat dangerous meal...&#10;&#10;In this card game, players take the role of Goblins at the Breakfast table, scrambling to eat as much food as possible and to prevent other players from doing the same.&#10;&#10;Illustrated by Travis Hansen, the game plays from 2 to 6 players, (more with multiple decks.)  It takes about 5 minutes to learn, and 15 minutes to play.  It includes about 60 cards.&#10;&#10;To start the game, a few cards are dealt out to the center table, and on each turn, players can do one of the following four things.&#10;&#10;A, They can take a food or weapon from the center of the table.&#10;B, If they have a bigger weapon than another player, they can steal another card from another player's hand.&#10;C, If they have a food card in hand they can eat it, scoring it.&#10;D, They can play a special action card from the center of the table, immediately playing its effects.&#10;&#10;The result is a fast-paced, light-hearted arms race, with quickly shifting strategy and chaotic fun.  After the deck runs out, the player that eats the most food wins!&#10;&#10;It should be noted that this game was a finalist for the 2014 Ion Awards at the SaltCon board game convention in Salt Lake City.&#10;&#10;\",\n",

With a dynamic play area based on every card played, the game constantly adapts itself to film fans of any level of skill or knowledge. Want to throw a wrench into things? Director's Cut cards can often hinder your friends or change the rules to keep things interesting. Now you finally have an outlet for that wealth of movie trivia building up in your brain!  &#10;Cinelinx is a new take on movie trivia games and is the perfect way to test your movie knowledge and challenge your friends during your next movie or game night!&#10;&#10;&#10;Rules&#10;1) Separate Director&rsquo;s Cut cards from the main deck and set them aside nearby. Then shuffle the main deck and allow each player to draw 10 cards.&#10;2) An anchor card is needed to start the game. We recommend locating a genre card from the main deck and dropping it in the center of the table to begin. The remaining genre cards should stay in the deck to be drawn randomly during gameplay.&#10;3) Decide amongst yourselves who will go first, and then continue playing clockwise.&#10;4) Players should take turns connecting cards in their hands to cards in play. Players can only play ONE card during their turn, unless instructed otherwise by a Director&rsquo;s Cut card.&#10;Tip: Cards can be dropped vertically or horizontally and connected to any open side of a card in play. The reels that are formed as cards connect should not touch unless a valid connection is made.&#10;&#10;5) Connections must be verbally announced to be considered valid. A connection can be defined as the relationship between two cards. See our official rulebook for complete connection details.&#10;Example announcement: &ldquo;Jonah Hill and Leonardo DiCaprio can be connected because they were both in &lsquo;The Wolf of Wall Street&rsquo;. &ldquo;&#10;&#10;6) During their turn, if a player does not have a playable card in their hand they can DRAW a card and play it immediately, if possible. If they still do not have a playable card in their hand they can draw a second time and play the card immediately, if possible. If they still do not have a playable card then their turn is over. &#10;Instead of drawing, if a player cannot play a card in their hand they can choose to SWAP up to three cards in their hand with three random cards from the main deck. Once a player has swapped cards their turn is immediately over. A player can only SWAP once per game. Cards that are discarded should be placed back into the main deck.&#10;7) A connection can be challenged at any time.&#10;8) The first person to shed their full hand wins.&#10;&#10;Director&rsquo;s Cut&#10;During gameplay, when someone plays a Directors card from their hand they are allowed to draw from the Director&rsquo;s Cut deck and should follow the instructions on the card they draw. Most Director&rsquo;s Cut cards can be played immediately. &#10;Challenging a play&#10;If a connection is challenged and is proven VALID then the challenger must either draw a card or lose a turn. The player who was challenged can decide which option the challenger should proceed with.&#10;If a connection is challenged and is proven INVALID then the player who was challenged must take their card back and draw an additional card. Their turn ends immediately after they draw.&#10;&#10;Download the Cinelinx Rulebook&#10;&#10;\",\n",

Technology has begun its slow and steady rise within civilization, while many still cling desperately to the magic of old. Astaria itself has grown into a vast, sprawling empire, yet rebellion is carried on whispers from deep within the shadows. The strength of steam could spark a revolution. But for the Eternals, the cycle continues as it always has. For them, there is only... strife.&#10;&#10;Strife: Shadows and Steam is a stand-alone sequel to Strife: Legacy of the Eternals. Using the same core mechanics, Strife: SaS introduces new characters, abilities and a unique twist or two that will be sure to add a fresh take on this exciting game. This sequel is also fully compatible with the original game, so you can face off with champions of Aerim from different ages!&#10;&#10;Strife, a two-player strategy card game that plays in around an hour, is a game where you always know your opponent's options. Aside from mastering the unique combo-creating gameplay of your champions, figuring out how to outmaneuver your opponent is where the true challenge lies.&#10;&#10;Each player has the same hand of ten champions and will simultaneously play them as they fight over key locations throughout Aerim worth varying victory points. Each champion has a battle ability that's triggered during battles and a legacy ability that can be used only while on top of the legacy pile. This creates an intricate latticework of strategy for the players as each champion must be considered for not only what he can do in the current battle, but for which ability he will add to the next.&#10;&#10;Further impacting the critical decisions within the game is the Fatestone tie-breaking system. The Fatestone starts at a value of one, and whoever holds the Fatestone die loses all ties; that player may instead pass the stone to his opponent to claim a victory in that tie, but doing so raises the value of the Fatestone by one each time it is passed. At the end of the game, the player holding the Fatestone adds its final value to his victory point tally. Whichever player has the most victory points at the end of the game wins!&#10;&#10;\",\n",

The Confederates were at the height of their military capabilities and were looking for a quick way to end the war by aiming at Washington. The battles of Brandy Station, Second Winchester, and Gettysburg were fought during this campaign.&#10;&#10;The game system uses a double blind system. One player takes the role of Gen. Robert E. Lee, the other acts as Maj.Gen. Joseph Hooker (until June 28th) and then Maj.Gen. Geore G. Meade. Movement determined by command points which is determined by quality of leaders. Rules include the variables of replacing Hooker with Meade. There are two identical maps with each player having one and hidden from each other. Players will need to search out the other's army by using cavalry and pickets. Victory is determined by destroying enemy units and capturing or defending real estate. Two additional scenarios: The Great Invasion (starting on turn 14), and Lee vs. Meade. Optional rules cover Rain, Bridge Burning, Naval Movement, Piccett Goes West, and Reynolds Takes Command.&#10;&#10;A complete game will take about four hours to play, but the additional scenarios can be finished faster.&#10;&#10;125 counters, two 17&quot;x22&quot; maps, two sheets for battleboard and Turn Record, 14 pages of rules.

Players choose from one of four unique Goblin Guilds, each with a special set of skills and tactical advantages, and build their army to destroy anyone that stands in their way. As battles are won and lost, players gain Victory cards, Victory Points, or the ability to upgrade their army. Who will be victorious, the mighty Fighters, the cunning Thieves, the powerful Clerics, or the magical Necromancers?&#10;&#10;To begin the game, players set up the Camp, the area of the game board housing Victory Point Tokens, action markers, the Kicker card deck, the Victory card deck, and the Upgrade deck. Next, players choose a Goblin Guild consisting of 25 units. In addition to the starting units of each Guild, players have 12 draft points to use in order to draft additional units to create their own unique army. All remaining units that are not drafted are combined to create the Upgrade deck.&#10;&#10;Players will compete in battle to gain 5 valuable Victory cards. Players will secretly set up their army's battle formation behind a Battle Screen. After shuffling their unit cards,  players will draw 5 cards into their hand. These 5 cards are then set up into a battle formation consisting of 1-3 units in the first row, 1-2 units in the second, and an optional 1 unit in the third combat row. Once all players' formations are complete, players remove their Battle Screens and combat begins. Players may first recruit any available units to their army, and may then choose to activate 1 combat skill per round. Next, damage between opposing Guilds is declared and resolved. As units take damage and are defeated, they are removed from combat and are placed in a player&rsquo;s discard pile. Combat continues until one Guild is left standing, with the winner gaining the first Victory card and its benefits. Players who lose the combat round may chose to upgrade a unit in their army. Once the 5th Victory card has been won, the player with the most Victory Points is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;Who will be victorious? Will it be the Mighty Fighters, the Cunning Thieves, the Powerful Clerics, or the Magical Necromancers? Choose your guild! Draft your army! Destroy your enemies!&#10;&#10;\",\n",

Voil&agrave;! is a fast-paced dexterity and push-your-luck type of game that will challenge your agility and finger swiftness.&#10;&#10;In Voil&agrave;! each player tries to get as many points as possible by completing various dexterity tasks. In a turn the player pulls out a token from the bag, which defines how many tasks the player has to complete (either none, one or two). However, for a turn player has limited amount of time, which is kept hidden from him by another player.&#10;&#10;After pulling out a token the player draws the corresponding amount of cards and tries to complete the tasks depicted of them. There are many different tasks, for example, throwing the token in the air and catching it, or creating a tower from acrobats and so on. After player has completed the task(s) he can either end the turn and thus get the points, or try to get more points by pulling out a new token and then completing the tasks. However, if the player chooses to continue, he must complete the task before he can end the turn and this is the risk - if the time runs out while he is still performing the task, the turn ends immediately and the player doesn't receive any points this turn (any cards the player completed during this turn are put in the discard pile).&#10;&#10;The game ends after each player has had three turns and the winner is the one with most total points on his cards.&#10;&#10;\",\n",

It was thought very little infantry would be needed.&#10;&#10;In the end, when the last Allied troops evacuated, the casualty count for both sides topped half-a-million. (And Churchill lost his job.)&#10;&#10;And yet, the big naval attack had almost succeeded. The Allies would not know until after the war ended how close they had come to achieving their breakthrough on the Dardanelles. It was the first of many &quot;what might have been&quot; episodes, where success was just one more push, one more aggressive movement away...in contrast to many times when failure was reinforced and repeated.&#10;&#10;Gallipoli is held as something sacred by the Australians and New Zealanders... as though they own it. The British would point out that the ANZACs made up less than 10% of the overall force and suffered less than 10% of the casualties. (But you can still get into a fight in Sydney if you talk like this!)&#10;&#10;A Fatal Attraction brings this campaign of tragedy and opportunity to life. The counters represent brigades, batteries, and ships, and players have the chance to do better than their historical counterparts, while gaining a greater appreciation for the difficulties faced by both sides, including supply shortages, command/control difficulties, and random events.&#10;&#10;With A Fatal Attraction, you'll find everything you need to understand Gallipoli except the smell and the flies.&#10;&#10;Published in Against the Odds magazine #20, August 2007&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: 1 week&#10;Map: Area&#10;Unit: Infantry Regiments/Brigades, Artillery Batteries and individual ships&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22&quot; X 34&quot; mapsheet&#10;One countersheet (280 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 12 page Game Rulebook&#10;Four pages of chart &amp; tables&#10;Complexity - Medium&#10;Solitaire suitability - Low&#10;Playing time - Up to 6 hours&#10;&#10;\",\n",

The players are awarded points for leading their herds of animals to the river deltas and waterholes of the Okavango. At a waterhole, the player must replace the drinking herd with the same number OR a higher number of animals of a single kind. If the player brings the same number of animals, the thirsty animals must have a higher ranking than the animals already drinking at the waterhole. If the player brings a higher number of animals, the ranking doesn't matter.&#10;&#10;In case of a river delta, the player has to replace the drinking animals with different animals AS WELL AS a higher number of animals than at the river delta at that time. In this case, the animals' ranking doesn't matter.&#10;&#10;But there are only a limited number of waterholes and animals. The players therefore need to be smart about gathering their animals into herds and allowing them to drink.

Thus, if you know that History is not for you, than you may win two books in the Biology room and exchange one of them for a History book.&#10;&#10;The game comes with 8,000 questions on 800 cards.&#10;&#10;This game is related to Det store norske spillet.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented as Kunskapsjakten.&#10;&#10;',\n",

       "  'description': \"Publishers blurb: &quot;STORM OF STEEL is a complete simulation of World War One. The three maps cover Europe from the Pyrenees to the Urals, plus the Middle East. Fighting rages from St. Petersburg to Verdun to Baghdad and beyond. The maps can be combined for one grand game of the Great War, or they may be used separately for theater-level campaigns of the eastern front, the western front and the Middle East. The game rules use a modular approach, which allows players to employ the level of complexity they desire. Turns are quarterly, but players can use special campaign cards to provide additional move-fight impulses, recreating the intensive offensives of the war. There are scenarios for each year and each front of the war, as well as a grand game for the entire war. There is also a &quot;what if&quot; scenario for the war continuing into 1919.&#10;&#10;Units represent land, naval and air forces. Ground forces are portrayed at corps level. Each corps is rated for the number of divisions it includes; so players can concentrate for the offensive or disperse for the defense. Corps include infantry, shock troops, mountain infantry and cavalry. There are also specialized armored car and tank brigades, as well as tank corps for 1919, plus the planned-for American airborne division. Each country has its own unique order of battle so, for example, the Austro-Hungarians have mountain corps, and there are also additional units representing Bolshevik and independent nationalist forces.&#10;&#10;Naval units are at the squadron level for capital ships, and flotillas for cruisers and destroyers. There is also a complete submarine warfare module for attacks on merchant shipping. Air warfare is represented by strategic and tactical wings. A unique feature of the game is players can improve their aerial warfare capabilities by increasing their air doctrine level. As air doctrine improves, players can employ interception, aerial supply and aircraft carrier operations. On the subversive side, players can utilize agents to conduct propaganda and sabotage operations to undermine their foes from within.&#10;&#10;Land combat uses three different combat results tables to model different tactics. Tank and shock troop units can use the much more effective Infiltration CRT. Naval combat requires opposing fleets to first acquire each other, then engage in gunnery. Lighter fleet units become invaluable for recon and screening, while battleships and battlecruiser squadrons close in for the kill. In the air, players can execute a variety of missions, including air superiority and bombardment.&#10;&#10;An industrial production module gives players the capability to produce different types of forces. Production is tied to morale, and winning great battles will enhance your side's output while a disastrous defeat may lead to strikes on the home front. Storm of Steel uses a card system to generate major operations. Campaign cards give players additional move-fight impulses, combat bonuses and extra reinforcements. Players have to carefully choose which campaigns they will implement because some cards, such as the Schlieffen Plan, will provide for more maneuver, while others, such as Verdun, will enhance combat. There are also cards that will grant tactical innovations such as chemical warfare and armored doctrine, as well as bringing into play leaders such as Hindenburg, Brusilov and Lawrence of Arabia.&quot;&#10;&#10;\",\n",

They start the round's bid, stating how many enemies they killed. The round continues with each player either believing the bidder, or bidding a higher number. At any time, though, any player can call out the bidder.&#10;&#10;If no one wants to up the bid further, the bidder now has to slay the enemies by building a dice pool out of their character's strength, any bonuses they have against the drawn enemy, and spent drinks, where one drink equals one extra dice. Every dice result that is equal to, or greater than the enemy's health, is one successful kill. If the bidder less enemies than they bidded, the caller gets one of their patrons. If the bidder kills more enemies than they bidded, they succeed and not only get one of the patrons from the caller, but they also get the drinks and patrons listed on the enemy card. If they kill exactly the same amount that they bidded, they activate the perfect bluff bonus on their character card, as well as the enemy's reward and the caller's patron.&#10;&#10;The winner of the last round (either the bidder or the caller) is the active player for the next.&#10;&#10;\",\n",

In his turn, a player can play cards; those cards usually are 'bussines cards', but each of then need two workers. If you don't have the correct worker you can hire to other players, then you have to negociate the cost.&#10;&#10;Others cards are 'special cards' that allow several efects (steal, kill on worker, police, anticipate news, get the money just now, and so on...) some of them can be played in any moment, but few of them can be played only in your turn. Of course, you can negociate the use and the target of that cards.&#10;&#10;When you end your turn, you draw or discard until you have seven cards.&#10;&#10;At the end of the round, there are revealed two cards from the 'news' deck, which are some special effects in the game like one worker goes to the jail, or one kind of bussines are not working.&#10;&#10;Then you get the money from your bussines cards and pay the agreements you had done (the agreements are mandatory).&#10;&#10;The richer player at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;All the name of the workers are 'spanish-word-joke'.&#10;&#10;The people in the bank-notes are friends and family of the designer.&#10;&#10;&#10;&quot;V&iacute;stete para la ocasi&oacute;n, ten el maletero de tu coche a punto y un buen pu&ntilde;ado de balas...&#10;&#10;Sum&eacute;rgete en los bajos fondos de la ciudad para controlar los negocios de la familia, ordena a tus secuaces que extorsionen en los barrios, influye sobre las leyes y g&aacute;nate a la polic&iacute;a.

Keep in mind that horses of this period were too small to &quot;ride&quot; with a man on their back in a &quot;cavalry&quot; way. Only chariots offered a battle platform faster than sandals, and provided the &quot;shock troops&quot; of their day and a platform to designate the aristocracy and elite peoples. Alexander and the Roman legions might sneeze at chariot power... but not for another 900 years!&#10;&#10;Kadesh must be the chariot battle of all time. Sources conflict and disagree, but there may have been as many as 5000 chariots in this twisted, confused, and bloody battle, fought to determine the borders between Egypt and the Hittite confederacy...&#10;&#10;As an early example of &quot;spin,&quot; Egyptian pharaoh Ramses II claimed a tremendous victory and the total vanquishing of the Hittite army... although he also signed a peace treaty that left the disputed city of Kadesh in the hands of the Hittites and never returned. Hmm. (A later and more formal treaty between Ramses and the next Hittite king is reproduced on the walls of the United Nations, as one of the first recorded international peace treaties. Ramses did not get Kadesh with that one either.)&#10;&#10;Now you can take the reins and lead your lines/lions into battle. Day of the Chariot: Kadesh offers a classic design by Gene Dickens fully updated into a tactical view of one of the most-discussed battles of middle eastern history, with 320 double-sided counters, 30 minute turns, and everything you need to play a system emphasizing command control and flexibility (or the lack thereof). Three distinct scenarios provide the battle that did happen (according to Ramses), the battle that both sides had &quot;prearranged&quot; to happen, and the smaller, more confused battle that historians think actually did happen. (You may be surprised how different the &quot;same&quot; battle can be!)&#10;&#10;',\n",

The game covers the period from 1 July to 4 July, 1863, when these two armies fought the bloodiest battle in American history to that point. The game system is an adaption fo the popular Napoleon at Waterloo system. Various special and optional rules allow the Players to recreate a picture of an historical event.&quot; (from the rules folder.}&#10;&#10;Cemetery Hill is one of four games included in the Blue & Gray Quadrigame set. The game includes a 17&quot; x 22&quot; three-color map, 100 counters and an Exclusive rules folder. A Standard rules folder, containing rules common to all four games included in the Quadrigame, is also included.&#10;&#10;Scale is 400 meters/hex. 1-2 hours per Game Turn. Game mechanics are a simple movement-combat system with rigid zones of control. Sequential Player Turns, retreat and advance after combat are common to these games and surrounding to cut off retreat is a major strategy.&#10;&#10;A new concept, &quot;Attack Effectiveness&quot; is introduced in this set of games. Essentially, attacking units that receive an &quot;Attacker Retreat&quot; result in combat are rendered &quot;ineffective&quot; (may not make further attacks, but still defend normally) for the rest of the day. This restriction is removed once a Night turn occurs. This makes &quot;what the heck&quot; type attacks very risky as one's army can be rendered quickly &quot;ineffective&quot; through a series of low-odd attacks.&#10;&#10;\",\n",

Each player controls the flow and pace of army building through a one-of-a-kind gameplay system formulated to deliver a full strategy experience.&#10;&#10;Players win the game by reducing their opponents' Stronghold Population to zero.

Each 50-card deck is represented by a different faction Commander from the three (3) factions available to players.

To keep it simple: the Pitch determines who will get the advantage in the at bat, and the Swing determines the result of the at bat.&#10;&#10;The game is played and scored just like traditional baseball using player cards that are Batters and Pitchers from real big league teams with suitable stats on a playmat resembling a baseball field. Play a full game (9 innings) consisting of  3  outs  per  &frac12;  inning,  with  the  Away  Manager  batting  in  the  top  half  of  the  inning. As you send each batter card up to the plate, there is a pitch roll and a swing roll to determine the result (out, walk, hit, home run, etc).&#10;&#10;Batter cards move around the bases to score runs like in real baseball. The game ends after 9 innings with the team that scored more runs being the winner - in the event of a tie you go to extra innings until one team comes out ahead!&#10;&#10;Strategy cards played at different times give bonuses or allow you to make real baseball plays like hit-and-run, defensive shifts or even a suicide squeeze.

       "  'description': 'Capek Golems is a card game for two players who take on the roles of competing engineer-alchemists trying to create Capek Golems, creatures who are an amalgam of steampunk technology and biological raw materials. Players will be using cards to buy scientific inquiry and field research resources racing to activate their golems before the tide of public outrage turns against them. A Public Outrage Track is used for this. If this track reaches (25) both players will lose, so they must work cooperatively to keep the public at ease about their experiments while still competing against each other.&#10;&#10;Requirements:&#10;For this game you&rsquo;ll need the deck of 54 cards consisting of:&#10;&#10;&bull; 12 Capek Golem body part cards, 6 per player&#10;&bull; 39 game cards showing areas of scientific inquiry, gold coins and field research journal entries&#10;&bull; 3 cards which make up the Auction House and Public Outrage Track&#10;&bull; 40 markers for the Capek Golem cards (eurocubes work well) [Alternately you can use 6d6 per player, placing one die on each Golem card and rotating the die up each time a resource is gained towards the specified total.] and one additional marker for the Public Outrage Track&#10;&#10;To win a player must activate all six parts of their Capek Golem. Activating a single card includes having all Field Research resources as well as playing one set of Scientific Inquiry cards matching the number total on one of the two colored circular icons. If the Public Outrage Track ever reaches (25) both players lose the game.&#10;&#10;Play:&#10;A player may do any of the following actions but may do each action only once during that turn:&#10;1. Buy cards from the Auction Area and play them immediately or place it in your hand.&#10;Purchase a single card at its Auction value by discarding cards with an equal or greater number of gold coins. Then discard it immediately and take Field Research resources as indicated, and move the token up or down the Public Outrage Track, or place the card in your hand and use it later on for its gold value or to complete a Scientific Inquiry set. Repeat buying a card as desired.&#10;&#10;2. Discard a set of Scientific Inquiry cards and mark gained resources on your Capek Golem Cards.&#10;Discarding a completed set, matching both a color and number as indicated on a Capek Golem card, allows you to place a marker in that resource area, helping to activate that card. You can choose either of the two color types to collect for a set, but you cannot make a set with a mix of both colors. There are 3 special wild cards in the game which may be used in any set and can take the place of one or two cards (as marked). If you use one of these cards in a Scientific Inquiry set, you must move the token on the Public Outrage Track as indicated.&#10;&#10;3. Discard one card to draw two new cards from the Draw Pile.&#10;A player may discard any one card from his hand to draw two new cards from the Draw Pile.&#10;&#10;Additional Rules of Play:&#10;If at the start of a player&rsquo;s turn the player has fewer than two cards in hand, they should draw two cards from the Draw Pile before completing any of the three actions.&#10;&#10;If the Draw Pile is ever exhausted, shuffle the Discard Pile and create a new Draw Pile.&#10;&#10;If at any time the marker is moved to the (25) space on the Public Outrage Track the game ends immediately and both players lose.&#10;&#10;Winner of the BGG Quick Print and Play Design Challenge&#10;&#10;',\n",

Well, everybody, that is, except for you.&#10;&#10;You, a simple peasant, have just received a most unexpected visitor: the princess' fairy godmother! She has warned you that all is not as it seems. The woman that Prince Micah is about to marry is not his one and only Princess Abigail, but is really an impostor who hopes to take over the kingdom for her own evil plans! She has placed an enchantment over the real princess, who now lies fast asleep in a cottage deep in the forest.&#10;&#10;The fairy godmother has explained to you that the only way to save the kingdom from a terrible fate is to awaken the princess with a rose and get her back to the castle in time to stop the wedding. Many dangers await, but the fairy godmother is willing to help you out on your perilous quest...for a small price (hey, even fairy godmothers need to eat!).&#10;&#10;Will you save the kingdom and live happily ever after? There's no time to lose if you wish to succeed. The sun is already beginning to set....&#10;&#10;Fairy Tale in my Pocket is a spinoff of Zombie in my Pocket that can be played solo or cooperatively with kids. In the game, you must explore the forest and the kingdom, creating the tile board and resolving event cards as you go. Some of these events allow you to buy helpful items from peddlers or to earn gold by spending time helping famous fairy tale characters. However, saving a kingdom is hard and dangerous work, and other events have you meeting up with robbers, dragons, and other unsavory characters who are hazardous to your health. Not only must you survive these encounters, but you must find the rose, awaken the princess, and return to the castle before the sun sets (three times through the event deck) in order to succeed.&#10;&#10;A number of scenarios have also been created to vary the gameplay.&#10;&#10;\",\n",

Players take turns dropping one of their eight marbles (glass stones) onto a square 7 x 7 game board. The momentum of the dropped marble is transferred in up to eight (orthogonal and diagonal) directions through adjacent contiguous lines of marbles. The last marble at the end of each of these lines is pushed away one cell from the dropped marble. Some fall off the board and are returned to the owning players.&#10;&#10;When a player has only one marble left in hand, he or she is required to announce the last marble. At which point, his opponent is forced to knock at least one of his other seven marbles off the board, otherwise the opponent would lose the game.&#10;&#10;The first player to have all eight of his or her marbles on the board at the end of his or her turn wins the game.&#10;&#10;For beginners and perpetual games the following rule applies to the standard 7 x 7 game.&#10; 30-Rounds Rule (Optional, recommended for beginners): If a game lasts for 30 rounds (60 player turns), play stops and the outcome is determined. If either player has a majority of marbles on the board that player wins, if not, the game ends in a draw. Players can use a spare token to keep track of rounds by using the outside edge of the board. Once around is 28 steps. Two more rounds and the game ends.&#10;&#10;',\n",

The game covers the Axis assault on the south-west Soviet Union, which began with the attack by Army Group South with 41 divisions (plus allied divisions) against a Soviet force of 60 divisions.  The game concludes in mid-August 1941, at which time, historically, 20 Soviet divions surrendered in the &quot;Uman Encirclement.&quot;&#10;&#10;The game contains a wealth of different unit types - including bridging units, motorcycle infantry, an armored train, a Soviet river flotilla, combat engineers, rocket artillery, anti-aricraft units, et., etc. - as well as the more standard armored, mechanized, and infantry units.  Supply, weather, and terrain all play their part, as do fortifications, strongpoints (these can be built each turn), air power, artillery, reinforcements and replacements, headquarters units, and reserves.  The game sequence includes &quot;reaction movement&quot; by units in reserve status, as well as separate motorized movement phases.  A particularly eleqant piece of design has the Axis motorized movement following standard movement and combat - thus facilitating armored breakthrough; for the Soviets the order is reversed, leading to poorer coordination between tanks and infantry...&#10;&#10;There are 4 scenarios - The Siege of Kiev is an introductory scenario lasting 7 turns, and using only Map B.  Rundstedt Attacks depicts the German assault on perhaps the strongest portion of the Soviet frontier; it last 5 turns and uses only Map A.  Secenario 3, &quot;Optional Deployment,&quot; is a variant of #2.  The Campaign Game lasts 27 turns and uses all 3 maps.  Victory is judged both in terms of combat losses, and the Axis capture of key geographical objectives.&#10;&#10;Historically accurate, fast paced, and playable - Blitzkrieg in the South is a worthy first entry in what will surely become the definitive East Front Series.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 2 days&#10;Hex: 5 miles / 8 Km&#10;Units: Battalion to Division&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;Three 22 x 34&quot; maps&#10;Two dual-side printed countersheets (400 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 20-page rules booklet&#10;One 1-page Turn Record Track&#10;Four 1-page scenario set-up cards (two Soviet &amp; 2 Axis)&#10;&#10;',\n",

To the mundane scholars of academe, the Trojan War was fought for control of the ancient Black Sea trade routes.  To the Romantic, it was fought over Helen of Troy, 'the face that launched a thousand ships and burned the topless towers of Ilium.' Whatever the cause, romantic or commercial, the war raged ten long years and involved the greatest warriors of that ancient age.  Behind them stood the Olympian gods who, although forbidden by Zeus from intervening decisively, nevertheless gave what help they could to the side they favored.  The Iliad is a fast-moving game of the entire ten-year war which has formed the basis for Homer's epic Iliad.  Features include -&#10;&#10;&#10;     Every important Greek and Trojan hero is individually represented&#10;     Heroes face each other in single combat as they vie for superiority&#10;     Olympian gods may receive appeals and aid their chosen heroes&#10;     Special rules cover the quarrel between Agamemnon and Achilles: if the quarrel is set aside, Achilles joins the battle, much to the dismay of the Trojans.&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;Outside references:&#10;&#10;&quot;Players Notes&quot; by S.

Each turn you have five actions to distribute between your on-field figures. The game takes place on field overlaid with a hex grid.  The aim is to throw the ball for a score into one of three score zones in your opponent's half. After scoring, your turn ends and the ball is launched back onto the field. At the core of the game are the actions. Each of your figures can have up to two of your five allowance spent on him. Players need to plan ahead, especially if they score, since the board does not reset afterwards. Available actions include move, slam (tackle), steal the ball, throw the ball, pick up the ball, and stand up. The actions all have the same basic mechanisms, so learning and remembering them is easy. Seven points or more, or, failing that, the highest score at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;KickOff is a simple new format that features a pocket-sized rulebook, game board, 2 basic starter teams and all the counters and dice needed to play.  It simplifies Dreadball by removing most valuable players, RefBot, fouls and league play. In the box you will find no cards, ref, roster pad or hex bases.

Players are arranged in teams, then the starting player has 15 seconds to try to get as many marbles as he can, saying words matching the category on the column, and beginning with the letter on the row. The uncomplete grid is then passed to the next player, who has 15 seconds to take some of the remaining marbles, and so on. When the grid is empty, or when everyone passes (i.e. when you only have on the grid marbles corresponding to a difficult or impossible letter/category match), points are scored. Category cards and letter tiles are then changed, marbles are randomly put again on the grid, and a new round begins.&#10;&#10;Category Game is a very nice reworking of a traditional pencil and paper game: I appreciate the fast pace induced by the 15 seconds sandtimer, the partnership play, the good assortment of category cards, and... the arguing!

The ensuing chain of events leads to the war expanding throughout Europe. A war fought at that time would&rsquo;ve found all European militaries woefully unprepared.&#10;&#10;Central to the play of the game are its &ldquo;crisis chits.&rdquo; They represent various diplomatic and military events that could bring other powers into the war. Players pick crisis chits depending on the number of crisis hexes (printed on the map) they control. The more such hexes they control, the greater the chances they have of gaining more allies. At the same time, grabbing too much territory can lead to political collapse at home, as domestic foes work to undermine your power before the conflict explodes into a wider war.&#10;&#10;Rhineland Crisis War is a two-player game. One player commands the Axis, controlling Germany and the countries that choose to align with Berlin. The other is the Allied player, who controls the anti-German forces. Each hex on the map represents 62 miles (100 km) from side to opposite side. Each full game turn represents one month. Units of maneuver are corps and armies.&#10;&#10;Special rules cover: crises, political collapse, reinforcements, replacements, terror bombing, railroads, fog of war, airpower, naval and amphibious operations, weather, neutrals, the Soviet Union, armistice and surrender, the Spanish Civil War, expeditionary forces, airborne units, air transport, fifth columns, alpine units, and anti-aircraft units. The turn sequence is as follows.&#10;&#10;I. Axis Player Turn&#10; A. Axis Mobilization Phase&#10; B. Axis Terror Bombing Phase&#10; C. Axis Movement Phase&#10; D. Axis Combat Phase&#10; E. Axis Rally Phase&#10; F. Axis Crisis Phase&#10;II. Allied Player Turn&#10; A. Allied Mobilization Phase&#10; B. Allied Terror Bombing Phase&#10; C. Allied Movement Phase&#10; D. Allied Combat Phase&#10; E. Allied Rally Phase.&#10; F. Allied Crisis Phase&#10;III. End of Turn Phase&#10;&#10;',\n",

One will be used for definitions, and each player writes his name on top of it.  The other will be used for guesses.  One of the players takes the dictionary and looks for an obscure word that, he thinks, all other players ignore (i.e. eguzla, exarch or jabot).  He spells the word and tells what kind of word (verb, name, adjective).&#10;&#10;Each player must now imagine and write down a plausible and convincing definition for this word.  The player with the dictionary writes the true definition.  When all players have written their definition down, the player with the dictionary takes all sheets, shuffles them, numbers, and reads aloud all the definitions.  If necessary, he may read those two or three times.  Each player must then write on his guess sheet who, in his opinion, has written each definition.&#10;&#10;When all players have written their definitions, the player with the dictionary unveils the truth and tells who wrote what.  Each player scores:&#10;&#10;     2 points if he found out the dictionary&#10;     1 point for each other player he found out&#10;     1 point for each player who thought his definition was the dictionary's one&#10;     If no one guessed what the true definition was, the player with the dictionary scores as many points as there are players.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;When all players have scored their points, the player with the dictionary gives it to the player on his left.

Unlike other North Africa wargames, there are 5 mini-maps located at the various termini of maneuver in the campaign, and where battles are waged as fascinating mini-games in their own right. Players try to sweep each map and force the action onto the next one in an effort to push their opponent out of the game.&#10;&#10;The looming Malta factor is accounted for most assiduously. While abstracted into many aspects of the game, players must always be mindful of Malta being made active (helping the Allies) or inactive (assisting the Axis). The Italian forces have their rightful place in the story unfolding on the game board, and the remarkable paucity of units turns every counter and hex into the kind of wargaming puzzle reminiscent of the glory days of those great contests from the Avalon Hill General magazine.&#10;&#10;The use of Supply Point markers, received in a fast, hassle-free way, to seize the initiative, replace losses and recover shattered formations, to light up a map and begin operations there (i.e., conduct player turns on it of maneuver and combat), and then to continue those player turns for another round. Each additional round of player turns must be paid for by another Supply Point, usually spent by the side that feels it is advantageous to press on and keep the opponent hard pressed, recreating simply and effectively the lulls and starts in battlefield operations that were a signature of this campaign.&#10;&#10;The desert lies before you and World War II is at stake.

The Confederate player is generally on the offensive, but the situation also calls for the Union player to make counterattacks.&#10;&#10;Each hexagon on the map represents nine miles (14.6 kilometers) from side to opposite side. The units of maneuver for both sides are represented using a &quot;strength point&quot; system in which each point equals approximately 100 troops. Each artillery unit represents about six guns. Each game turn represents half a month.&#10;&#10;\",\n",

Seega persists today in parts of North Africa. It is played on a 5x5 board (a &quot;Knights&quot; solitaire board is ideal for this) with each player having 12 pieces (usually marbles).  Players alternately place two of their pieces on the board until all spaces except one are occupied. No captures are made during this deployment phase. The player who placed the last pieces then moves one piece one space orthogonally, attempting to take opponent's pieces by custodial capture (i.e. &quot;sandwiching&quot;). A piece on the central square - usually marked with a cross - is safe from capture. If a player cannot make a legal move, their opponent continues to play until an opening appears. To win, reduce your opponent to one piece (or none). Draws often occur.   Variants are played on larger boards (8 x 8 etc.) and/or with different capturing conditions, such as jumping, as in draughts/checkers.&#10;&#10;\",\n",

For example, &quot;Remember When ..., while looking for my other sock, in the crowded grocery store, I repeatedly kissed the furry caveman because the Great Conjunction was at hand!?&quot;&#10;&#10;But the Active Player does not create this Sentence/Memory from their own cards.  The other players are rapidly trying to assist the Active Player by submitting one card each.  The Object and the Action Taken are determined first and read out loud, so the players have some context for their card submissions.  Once one card of a type/color (i.e. &quot;Blue&quot;) has been submitted then another available color must be submitted.  As the players submit their cards to the Active Player, face down, they are trying to guess which of those 4 words/phrases the Active Player will actually choose.  If they are correct in their guesses then both they and the Active Player will get points for matching.&#10;&#10;Once the Active Player has assembled their sentence, scored it for &quot;helping points&quot;, then they read the completed sentence aloud (we suggest as dramatically as possible).  This is because the other players will be voting on which memory of the evening is the most exciting of all!&#10;&#10;Also try the game out FOR FREE online at Board Game Arena!&#10;&#10;\",\n",

The throne is within the grasp of any rival faction bold and cunning enough to grab power for themselves.&#10;&#10;However, this is a nuanced conflict, one where diplomacy cuts just as sharply as the weapons of an army, but half as so as the assassin&rsquo;s blade. There are wheels within wheels and machinations beyond your view.&#10;&#10;Players represent powerful houses, each seeking to be in ascent of the throne. Every player has the same six cards, which provide Strength, Favor, Victory Points, and bonuses. Unfortunately, the path forward is shrouded in fog, forcing players to manage the uncertainty of the times.&#10;&#10;Every round, players draft a hand of cards, choosing a mix of their cards, their opponents&rsquo;, and powerful Events. The key is building a viable strategy with your own cards and events, while denying key cards from your opponents. Then, cards are played face down one at a time to the Planets. Limited information about each card is disclosed. Players are forced to make decisions with imperfect information gained during the draft and by reading your opponents. Finally, the cards are revealed and resolved. In most cases, players want to be the Strongest or Favored faction to score Victory Points.&#10;&#10;',\n",

The Aliens attacked the Earth and destroyed 99% of humanity using orbital death rays. However, the weapon interacted strangely with human DNA and caused an unforeseen mutation! Within 24 hours of death, the recently dead arose and slowly shambled aimlessly with purpose in the general direction of the Alien attackers to take their revenge.&#10;&#10;Aliens vs. Zombies is a small, low-complexity wargame for beginners, children and light-hearted fans of aliens and/or zombies. The aliens are invading a small town. A side effect of their weapons used to conquer humanity is the reanimation of the newly dead, who are out for revenge!&#10;&#10;The alien player has fewer units but has the advantage of superior weaponry and armor. Zombies are plentiful and are divided into different types: rotting, tough and fast. Both sides can move or attack during their turn. Each side has one unique action: aliens can blast away with exploding dice and zombies can chomp their opponents to create new allies.&#10;&#10;Each turn a tile is revealed with a number of zombie spawns and special events. After the 8th turn, the zombie dead (those deader than usual) are counted to determine the victor.&#10;&#10;Which side will you choose?

The US commander, Gen. Lloyd Fredendall, had overextended his lead units, dividing them into individual, unsupported packets while disregarded his flanks. Rommel was quick to recognize the opportunity to inflict a defeat on the untested Americans, and he soon mounted an offensive with two panzer divisions.&#10;&#10;Kasserine utilizes the new Fire &amp; Movement combat system that's designed so players can augment their units with &quot;support fire&quot; during the course of the turn. From artillery to dive bombers, units can receive support to engage enemy positions and formations, allowing combat to develop at all levels. A single recon battalion, for example &mdash; perhaps supported by mortars &mdash; could be tasked to assault a lone enemy infantry regiment defending a ridge. As that attack gets underway, however, the recon battalion may find itself advancing through a minefield. More support will be necessary to take the ridge, but assets are limited.&#10;&#10;In Kasserine, the attritional design of the new Combat Results Table simulates the true nature of the battles in North Africa. Units are typically two-sided formations that can suffer casualties, accurately replicating the realities of combat and the high losses sustained by both sides during the actual fighting at Kasserine Pass. Winning is thus a matter of maneuver, firepower and asset management.&#10;&#10;\",\n",

At the turn of the 20th century, a Miskatonic Psychotherapist analyzing the dreams of his patients tapped into nightmares of Leng Spiders and Moon-Beasts. In the 1920's, a Private Eye investigating the disappearance of her farming parents revealed Star Vampires and Mi-Gos as the culprits.

The 5 high structures are: Castle, Cathedral, Monument, Harbour, and Town Square.&#10;&#10;Then, play through the deck of the remaining cards (called a round) and use resources on adjacent cards, and resources provided by already built structures to build additional structures.  Play multiple rounds to get everything you need to build your selected high structure.  Continue playing to accumulate additional victory points.&#10;&#10;Victory points are awarded several ways:&#10;- Victory points marked on some of the structure cards&#10;- 1 victory point for each different structure built&#10;- 2 victory points for each pair of identical structures built&#10;- 5 victory points is a second &quot;high structure&quot; is built&#10;&#10;Final score for each game is total victory points minus the number of rounds played.

In most railroad board games, one player is one company, and is engaged in pure competition with the other players.  That doesn't make for a very social experience.  Since players are investors in Railroads, they have the opportunity to benefit from semi-cooperative ventures, while hedging out their allies with other investments.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Railroads is not a game about budgets and check books.  Money functions as points and are never spent.  Stock tokens are played and moved in a simplified fashion that means strategy is emphasized and budgeting is eliminated.  Stocks are merely methods of earning money (scoring points) so players can focus on their larger plans.&#10;&#10;Players who play alone in Railroads will not do very well.  Railroads only gain as much track per turn as there are players in the company.  If there is only one player in the company, they only lay one track per turn and will not make a lot of money.  However, if you can get one or two people to join your venture, you can double or triple the speed that your railroads grow, turning your fledgling railroad into a geopolitical force to be reckoned with. Just make sure that when the money dries up, you are the first one out.&#10;&#10;\",\n",

Advisors use up the easy, sensible solutions and force Kim Jong-un into ridiculous extremes of problem solving, and while making themselves as troublesome as possible they must be acting as helpful and servile as possible, pleasing the Leader while frustrating him.&#10;&#10;Each round begins with the draw of a Policy Card that one player reads aloud. The Policy Card describes a threat to North Korea which upon which Kim Jong-un must render a decision. After each advisor has suggested their own unique solution to the issue at hand, Kim must come up with his own completely novel answer to prove he's smarter than everyone in the room and always knows best. And this, of course, is the correct answer.&#10;&#10;The advisors clap with delight over this display of wisdom, whether they like it or not, and then take turns extrapolating Kim&rsquo;s solution to make it grander and grander. Kim then insults each offering for suggesting that it improves on his wisest of decisions.&#10;&#10;Throughout the round Kim continually issues demerits to punish advisors for infractions real and imagined. Demerits have no hard mechanical function in the game but enable Kim Jong-un to harass the other players and create more fun.&#10;&#10;At the end of a round, Kim Jong-un awards the Policy Card to whomever pleased him the most for whatever reason. That player becomes the new Kim Jong-un and a new round begins. At the end of the game players read grim factoids off the backs of the Policy Cards they've won, letting them know about the horrors in the real Hermit Kingdom.  This is a simple, fun game which tries to use the play of the game to lay bare the real world human rights abuses in North Korea.&#10;&#10;Reviews at:&#10;http://oneshotpodcast.com/podcasts/one-shot/155-dear-leader/&#10;https://www.shutupandsitdown.com/podcastle/podcast-42-fairytale-in-north-korea/&#10;&#10;\",\n",

You shape seven hundred years of vampiric and human history in pursuit of ancient secrets, while trying to evade the inquisition and attempting to save what's left of your humanity.&#10;&#10;Heritage is a quick-playing legacy game. Each game, players gather characters from a common pool for their bloodlines. These characters influence different vampiric &quot;battlegrounds&quot; and help in fulfilling history-based missions. For example, a noble-born warrior might support Joan of Arc in ending the siege of Orleans, while at the same time changing the balance of an internal vampiric power struggle or attracting the unwanted attention of the inquisition. Aside from collecting characters in their bloodline, players can also use the unique intrigue cards of the clan they are playing &mdash; changing the rules of the game in ways that fit the character of that particular clan.&#10;&#10;After any individual game, the players get to collect their achievements in their timeline, which serves as a chronicle of their actions throughout the seven hundred years of history and also influences the final outcome of the campaign.&#10;&#10;Additionally, players may turn some mortals into vampires permanently by taking the cards out of their sleeves and turning them around, revealing their vampiric side and giving them new abilities and a name. These get put back in the common pool and can be additionally enhanced in future games. To allow for surprises when embracing mortals, all character cards come pre-sleeved!&#10;&#10;In this fashion, players proceed through history as determined by the progression of historic mission cards, unlocking new challenges, characters, and rewards along the way.&#10;&#10;Eventually, the seven hundred years will end with a climactic conclusion as players scramble to unravel ancient mysteries using the clues, allies, and power they have gathered throughout the campaign.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;\",\n",

It shares a very close build up and look with its ancestor, but it also bears some custom traits which give it an &quot;Italian&quot; taste.&#10;First off, the horses's names are unmistakably Italian: Nearco, Niccol&ograve; Dell'Arca, Orsenigo, Astolfina...&#10;I wouldn't put my hand across a flame saying that they're all real names, but undoubtedly some of them are.&#10;The gameboard is double sided (in the '70s version instead you had to change the board simply folding a flap page over it) with the training course on one side and the racing track on the other.&#10;The game is played in two distinct phases: training and race.&#10;During the training phase all the players bid to get the fastest horses, usually the black or red ones, and occupations which can give them more money to bet before the race.&#10;Then starts the training. Every horse, starting from no.1 to no.12, gets out from its stables (San Siro at Milan or Capannelle at Rome) and rolling two dice it runs one full lap, before re-entering its own stable.&#10;During this lap the players collect Advantage colored chits (to be used as bonus during the race) or Disadvantage white chits (to be spent during the race as penalties), and pay various taxes for the maintenance, health and fitness of their horses.&#10;To be said, a good training isn't enough to grant you have a winner, because the subsequent race phase bears a great share of randomness.&#10;Totopoli is not only a racing game, but a betting one also, so this is perfectly normal.&#10;Luck and tactics here join together while you're searching for the best lane in every situation, but along the track some dangers are lurking to slow or either exit your horse from the race.&#10;You can win the game as being the winner at the race, or you can win through your money.&#10;And you can play dirty to ease the way for the horse you bet on.&#10;The box includes a double sided board, 12 plastic horses, 78 cards, Advantage and Disadvantage chits, bet bills and two dice.&#10;&#10;\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Detective: City of Angels, set in the dark and violent world of 1940s Los Angeles, is a game of mystery, deception, and investigation for 1&ndash;5 players. Most players will step into the shoes of LAPD homicide detectives, hungry for glory and willing to do whatever it takes to successfully close a case, even if that means intimidating suspects, concealing evidence, and hiring snitches to rat on their fellow detectives. One player, however, will take on the role of The Chisel, whose only goal is to stall and misdirect the detectives at every turn using bluffing, manipulation, and (often) outright lies.&#10;&#10;Detective: CoA uses the innovative ARC (Adaptive Response Card) System to create the feel of interrogating a suspect. Suspects do not simply give paragraph-book responses; instead The Chisel carefully chooses how they will answer. When Billy O'Shea insists that the victim was a regular at Topsy's Nightclub, is he telling the truth or is The Chisel subtly leading the detectives toward a dead end that will cost them precious time? Detectives can challenge responses that they think are lies but at great risk: If they're wrong, The Chisel will acquire leverage over them, making the case that much harder to solve.&#10;&#10;Detective: CoA includes separate, detailed casebooks for both the detectives and The Chisel. Each crime is a carefully constructed puzzle that can unfold in a variety of ways depending on how the detectives choose to pursue their investigations. As the detectives turn the city upside down, uncovering fresh evidence and &quot;hot&quot; leads, hidden suspects may be revealed and new lines of questioning will open up, creating a rich, story-driven experience.&#10;&#10;Inspired by classic film noir like The Big Sleep, the works of James Ellroy (L.A. Confidential), and the video game L.A. Noire from Rockstar Games, Detective: City of Angels is a murder-mystery game unlike any other. Will one detective rise above the rest and close the case on L.A.'s latest high profile murder? Or will The Chisel sow enough doubt and confusion to prevent the detectives from solving the crime?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;\",\n",

On their turn, they choose two frogs from 60 tiles placed face down.  If the two tiles are consecutive, they choose a third. If this too matches, they can place the three frogs on their board or keep trying to get more matches. If they miss, all frogs are returned to the table (a bit like Can't Stop).&#10;&#10;There is a also a variant for older children and adults that allows players to find matches solely to remove frog tiles form the game and make it impossible for others to complete their board.&#10;&#10;This is a good game and one that adults will like to play with children in the same way as Zapp Zerapp or Zicke Zacke H&uuml;hnerkacke.&#10;&#10;\",\n",
